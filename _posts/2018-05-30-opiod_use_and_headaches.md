# The Opiate Epidemic and Headache




Opiate abuse has gained national attention this decade, and this attention led me to revist
work I performed for my masters practicum.  

- general summary of where the data came from
- basic descriptive data analysis
- Overuse of loratab
- Summary between communities
  - by income
  - by county
- limitations,
- situation likely different now
