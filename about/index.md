# Welcome

I am currently a graduate student at Univeristy of California Los Angeles pursing a PhD in Human Genetics.  I work in Matteo Pellegrini's [lab](https://www.pellegrini.mcdb.ucla.edu/) studying the relationship between DNA methyaltion and metabolic health. This blog is a place for me to post my thoughts on genetics, politics, and other random musings.
